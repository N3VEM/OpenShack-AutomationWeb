OpenShack-AutomationWeb


Part of the larger OpenShack project, this repository is for the code for html/php interface, python scripts for sensor data to be displayed in that interface, etc.

This repository focuses primarily on items that would be used on a machine dedicated to "automation" or "control" functions.
